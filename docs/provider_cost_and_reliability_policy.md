# Provider Cost And Reliability Policy

Status: user-confirmed operational policy.

Decision date: 2026-07-11.

This file records account-specific cost and reliability facts that influence
future provider selection. It does not make a deferred provider available and
does not replace the phase gates in `ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md`.

## Active Phase 1 Decision

- The user's Aliyun/DashScope API workflows use the Beijing region. For the
  current credential, use canonical region `cn-beijing` with the confirmed
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint
  `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`.
- Qwen image recognition is billed independently by usage. On 2026-07-11 the
  user authorized unrestricted API use for implementation and robustness
  testing. Each comparable gate still declares its complete call plan before
  dispatch; never selectively retry one fixture or hide failed evidence.
- A single-draft review configuration makes two same-model provider calls per
  recognition. The v6 gate therefore used 13 recognition invocations and 26
  provider calls.
- The v8 robustness gate explicitly requests two independent drafts plus one
  consensus review: 13 recognition invocations and 39 provider calls. Consensus
  is quality work, not retry or provider fallback; ordinary library recognition
  remains one call by default.
- The v10 gate keeps the same 39-call maximum and exact plan but changes its
  composition to one Qwen3.7 primary plus two `qwen-vl-max` visual-sign scouts
  per recognition. Scout mode is explicit and defaults off. Qwen-VL scout prose
  is never returned; only a bounded two-scout standalone-sign quorum can alter
  primary Markdown locally.
- V11 raises the scout count from two to three and uses a two-of-three quorum.
  Its fixed comparable gate is therefore 13 recognitions and 52 calls. The
  third scout improves missing-sign quorum probability without adding a slow
  generative rewrite; it remains explicit and defaults off.
- The Phase 1 model remains `qwen3.7-plus-2026-05-26` unless the authoritative
  decision is changed before collecting a new complete evidence set.

## Future Provider Inputs

These are user-supplied account facts, not universal pricing claims. Reconfirm
entitlements and current product terms before a large run.

- Aliyun FileTrans ASR is covered by the user's previously purchased token
  package plan and is suitable for large audio robustness tests without
  incremental usage cost under that account. FileTrans remains Phase 4 work;
  this policy does not authorize audio implementation during Phase 1.
- Google models are available without usage cost to the user but have been less
  stable. A future Google adapter must prove its own error and quality gates;
  price does not compensate for unreliable completion.
- The user describes Codex Mini 5.4 as inexpensive and very stable, but not
  free. Treat that name as a user-facing provider choice until a future adapter
  decision pins an exact API model identifier and verifies current availability.

## Library Architecture Consequences

- Do not hard-code prices, token-package balances, or free-tier assumptions in
  the recognition core. They drift and may be account-specific.
- Keep provider capability, cost preference, stability preference, rate policy,
  and media processing as separate responsibilities. A future execution-policy
  object may rank approved workflows, but it must not turn one `Config` into an
  implicit multi-provider state machine.
- Provider pools, automatic switching, Google, Codex, and FileTrans remain
  behind their phase decisions. Complete the current one-provider image gate
  before activating any of them.
- Every paid or quota-consuming evidence run records its exact call plan before
  dispatch and preserves failures rather than cherry-picking a better result.
- The four screenshots and PDF under `docs/` are authorized as private local
  testing data. Use and provider submission are allowed. Keep them untracked and
  do not redistribute or commit them unless the user separately grants that
  permission. PDF implementation remains behind its phase gate.

## Change Rule

Update this file and the authoritative GO/NO-GO decision together when a
provider's billing, entitlement, model identifier, region, or observed
reliability changes. Never commit credentials or account balances.

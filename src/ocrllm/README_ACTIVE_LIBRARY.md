# Active Library Package

This directory is the new `ocrllm` Python package. It is the only codebase in
this repo intended for direct import by other projects.

## Public Contract

```python
from ocrllm import (
    Cancelled,
    CapabilityReport,
    Config,
    ConfigError,
    DashScopeSettings,
    DependencyMissing,
    InvalidSource,
    NoSpeechDetected,
    OCRLLMError,
    OutputError,
    OutputExists,
    ProviderError,
    ProviderUnavailable,
    QuotaExhausted,
    RateLimited,
    RecognitionResult,
    UnsupportedFormat,
    recognize,
    recognize_batch,
    get_capabilities,
)
```

Phase 0 contract honesty, Phase 1 real board/image, and Phase 2 versioned JSONL
worker are GO. Phase 2A image-library completion is active; local OCR through
the direct facade is the current slice, while Phase 3 PDFium remains not
started.

The current image facade:

- accepts `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.jpeg`;
- decodes and validates every input before provider dispatch;
- copies validated bytes into request-scoped snapshots isolated from later
  caller-path changes;
- passes those ordered snapshots to one synchronous injected provider;
- rejects invalid provider output and maps failures to typed/redacted errors;
- returns `source_type="image"` and `profile="board"`;
- keeps output in memory unless `output_dir` requests atomic Markdown output;
- loads Pillow lazily from the optional `ocrllm[image]` extra.
- resolves the exact built-in provider name `"dashscope"` only when immutable
  `DashScopeSettings` is present, while keeping `openai` and `httpx` lazy behind
  `ocrllm[dashscope]`.
- freshly revalidates an exact public `Config`; injected providers retain the
  caller's config identity, while the built-in adapter uses an isolated,
  revalidated copy.

The built-in DashScope board/image capability is available under the bounded
Phase 1 contract. The v17 Beijing gate completed exactly 52 provider calls with
no retry; both independent full-corpus runs passed. Run B repaired exactly one
missing handwriting sign through generic two-of-three omission consensus; no
handwriting route or model split exists. The committed Git-archive wheel then
passed base, `image`, and `image,dashscope` clean profiles.
`get_capabilities()` reports every known atomic capability without a network
call or optional import. With an explicit config, it reports that exact
workflow's proven status rather than treating installed code as sufficient.
Phase 2 exposes a spawned one-job manager with bounded JSON event bridging and
verified five-second descendant cancellation. The production image job adapter
reuses the same unified facade once per ordered group, fixes the Beijing v17
configuration, and adds no handwriting route, fallback, or retry.
`python -m ocrllm.worker` now composes that adapter with the isolated manager;
the shell-free Node JSONL, Unicode-path, and descendant-cancellation gates pass.
The Beijing live production-worker smoke and clean committed-source proof also
pass; `worker.jsonl.v1alpha1` is available. This remains a development worker,
not packaged Electron compatibility.
The direct facade now also has an available explicit local-OCR mode backed by
lazy maintained RapidOCR/ONNX Runtime dependencies in the `ocr` extra. It makes
zero provider/network calls and warns that OCR text extraction is not equivalent
to formula/table/layout-aware vision. Its clean committed and fresh-extra gates
pass.
The adapter requires an explicit matching region and endpoint, accepts
`qwen3.7-plus`, the default pinned `qwen3.7-plus-2026-05-26`, and explicit
configured scout work, disables OpenAI SDK retries, and builds Base64 data
URLs rather than sending local paths. The v17 evidence candidate uses one
thinking-enabled pinned Qwen3.7 transcript plus three independent
thinking-enabled omission ledgers from the same pinned model, each conditioned
on the quoted inert primary. Only exact allowlisted records can reach
two-of-three deterministic quorum; scout prose and unsupported punctuation
cannot enter the result. Directional-arrow insertion is forbidden while
complete primary transcription remains unchanged. Exact dynamic scout-prompt
hashes and byte counts are returned in metadata.
Qwen-VL Max remains an explicit supported scout option but is not the Phase 1
evidence baseline. There is still no local OCR backend, key pool, automatic
retry/model fallback, or image resume; PDF, audio, and video remain unavailable.
Local user screenshots are uncommitted
supplemental material and never replace the committed corpus in pass/fail
evidence.

Read `../../docs/ocrllm_library_go_no_go.md` before active-library work. It is
the authoritative source for file responsibilities, GO gates, and the
migrate/rewrite/reject boundary.

## Belongs Here

- Stable public API code.
- Provider interfaces and small provider adapters after they are tested.
- Dependency-light processing code that can be imported safely.
- Behavior ported from `legacy_app/` one tested vertical slice at a time.

## Does Not Belong Here

- PyQt GUI code.
- FastAPI server code.
- Social downloader integrations.
- Desktop launcher behavior.
- Package-relative runtime output defaults.
- Direct imports from `legacy_app` or uppercase `OCRLLM`.
- PyMuPDF or `fitz`; the future PDF slice uses PDFium through `pypdfium2`.
- HarmonyOS/ArkTS code or compatibility claims; that work is deferred.

## Tests

Use the root test suite for this package:

```powershell
uv run --no-project --isolated --with 'Pillow==12.3.0' `
  --with 'pytest>=8,<10' --with 'openai>=2.30,<3' `
  --python 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' `
  python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

The import contract must stay true:

```powershell
& 'D:\Anaconda\envs\OCRLLM\python.exe' -c `
  "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src'); import ocrllm; print(ocrllm.__version__)"
```
